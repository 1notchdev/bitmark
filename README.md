# Bitmark
Our aim is to create a relatively stable, user focussed, crypto currency which refines and implements maturing innovations from the crypto currency sector.

### Unique creations since launch
* [getMarked](http://getmarked.org), our flagship global adoption program
* [Investor Public Mining (IPM)](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki/IPM-Pool)

### Overview
**Technically**: Light and stable with a modern codebase, [maturing features from the alternative currency sector](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#maturing-innovations) which *benefit* users added on a faster timeline than bitcoin. Think of it more as [standardization rather than innovation](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#relatively-stable).

**User focussed**: Daily development effort and innovation goes in to making bitmark as [user friendly, and simple to integrate](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#user-focussed) as possible.

**Adoption**: In line with being user focussed, all marketing and outreach will be to potential adopters, such as [microtransaction marketplaces](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki/Microtransactions-and-Microtrust). The project is crafted in such a way that encourages all involved to focus on adoption.

**Earned Value**: no hype, no rush to get on exchanges, no ipo, premine, it's not a cash cow, it's a project to make a viable every day currency, any value will be earned. 

**Longevity**: 0.250% (max) of the block reward goes to the [bitmark development fund](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki/Development-Fund), supporting long term dedication to to the project, and future growth as value grows.

**Distribution**: A [configuration](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#block-chain-parameters) which aims to ensure [fair distribution](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki/Currency#supply-and-distribution) whilst using [proven PoW](https://github.com/project-bitmark/bitmark/wiki#proof-of-work) which has had substantial investment in hardware.

So, no hype or gimmicks, just a project which focusses on becoming a stable every day currency. Remember the days when the first bitcoins were gifted to each other, when buying a pizza was a milestone, when it was about developing a useful currency, when we asked how can we get x to use this, rather than what it it be worth tomorrow? this is about getting back to that ethos, whilst recognising the space has moved forward.
