# Bitmark
Our aim is to create a relatively stable, user focussed, crypto currency which refines and implements maturing innovations from the crypto currency sector.

* [The Bitmark Project - Documentation and Plan](https://github.com/coinsolidation/bitmark/wiki)

## SOURCE CODE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT

### Current status
 * fully working with temporary chains *all chains will be wiped before release*
 * desperately require a dedicated server so we can launch Bitmark

### Building
 * Tested bitmark-qt, bitmarkd and bitmark-cli on various linux distributions
 * check doc/build-* for details on how to build (same as bitcoin, different to alts based on old codebases)

### Testing
 * please help test, follow the [ann thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=660544.0) to discuss and make contact
