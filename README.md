# Bitmark
Our aim is to create a relatively stable, user focussed, crypto currency which refines and implements maturing innovations from the crypto currency sector.

* [The Bitmark Project - Documentation and Plan](https://github.com/coinsolidation/bitmark/wiki)

## SOURCE CODE IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, TESTNET ONLY!

### Current status
 * based on bitcoin 0.9.2.1, scrypt support added
 * block chain configured
 * testnet working, internal mining
 * needs a dedicated server for main test node!

### Building
 * only tested bitmarkd and bitmark-cli on various linux distributions
 * check doc/build-* for details on how to build (same as bitcoin, different to alts based on old codebases)

### Testing
 * please help test, follow the [ann thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=660544.0) to discuss and make contact
